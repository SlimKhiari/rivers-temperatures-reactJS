# Technical Test - React JS

## Description
You are asked to create a web interface, which can for example be displayed on a screen in a tourist office, allowing you to consult the latest temperature readings of the rivers of the Gironde department.

The interface must be readable and easily understandable.

### Optional
Possibility of adding graphs allowing to consult the variations of the temperatures of a river over a selected period.

## API
You will need, for data, to use the API:

 ``` Hubeau - RIVER TEMPERATURE ``` (https://hubeau.eaufrance.fr/page/api-temperature-continu#/).


The API console on the site has some problems, so it is advisable to use another platform to test the API.
